Time Complexity
When we use enqueue, we simply create a new node and add it to the tail of the list.
And when we dequeue an item, we simply get the value from the head of the list and then
shift the head variable so that it refers to the next node over.

Both of these operations happen in constant timeâ€”that is, they have a time-complexity of O(1).
