In this exercise you are going to apply what you learned about stacks with a real world problem.
We will be using stacks to make sure the parentheses are balanced in mathematical expressions
such as: ((3^2+8)âˆ—(5/2))/(2+6).

In real life you can see this extend to many things such as text editor plugins and
interactive development environments for all sorts of bracket completion checks.

Take a string as an input and return True if it's parentheses are balanced or False if it is not.
