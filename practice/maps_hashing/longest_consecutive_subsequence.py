Problem Statement

Given list of integers that contain numbers in random order, write a program to
find the longest possible sub sequence of consecutive numbers in the array.
Return this subsequence in sorted order. The solution must take O(n) time

For e.g. given the list 5, 4, 7, 10, 1, 3, 55, 2, the output should be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that
elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can
be in any order.

Return this subsequence in sorted order.

The solution must take O(n) time

For e.g. given the list 5, 4, 7, 10, 1, 3, 55, 2, the output should be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

One Solution is to first sort the array and find the longest subarray with consecutive
elements. Time complexity of this solution is O(nLogn).

We can solve this problem in O(n) time using an Efficient Solution.

The idea is to use Hashing. We first insert all elements in a Set.
Then check all the possible starts of consecutive subsequences.

Below is the complete algorithm.

    Create an empty hash.
    Insert all array elements to hash.
    Do following for every element arr[i]
    Check if this element is the starting point of a subsequence.
        To check this, we simply look for arr[i] â€“ 1 in the hash, if not found,
        then this is the first element in subsequence.
    If this element is the first element, then count number of elements in the
        consecutive starting with this element. Iterate from arr[i] + 1 till
        the last element that can be found.
    If the count is more than the previous longest subsequence found, then update this.
