Calculate Big O

Once you have completed your solution for each problem, perform a run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of your solution. Document this for each problem and include this in your submission.

TASK0

Functions readTexts() and readCalls()

Not certain how Python csv.reader function works since this is a builtin method. If it takes each line of the file, assumed as it is provided a delimiter, then it would be a linear function. The for loop to append each line to a list is linear O(n) as it is dependent on the size of the input. As there are two files to import combined they would be O(2n).

The main function splits the first list item and the last list item into component parts. These should be O(1) - constant time. The split of the calls list uses len, which is also O(1).

TASK1

Functions readTexts() and readCalls()
Same as Task0

Finding the count of unique phone numbers:
Uses for loops to iterate through the list. This should be linear O(n) as it must read each element regardless of size.Then each list item is add to a set if it is unique.

Determining whether items are unique and adding them to a unique data structure to obtain the count.

Two methods were used: first method used 'if not in' logic and added them to a unique list of numbers. The second method used Python's set() .add method: uniqueSetTest(). Times analysis using time.process_time() shows that the set() method is faster.

TASK2

Determining which telephone number spent the longest time on the phone:
Uses two for loops. 1) to iterate through the list of calls. This should be linear O(n) as it must read each element regardless of size. 2) Second for loop splits the call list items. This second for loop should be linear O(n) as it too requires cycling through each element in the list. Also, during the second iteration it examines the value to build a dictionary; appending key-value pairs if not found otherwise updating the value to total call duration. It then examines each call length to determine if it is the maximum value and stores it in variables if it is - requiring O(n).

TASK3

Uses a for loop to iterate through the list of calls. This should be linear O(n) as it must read each element regardless of size.
Finding the area codes involves string slicing. Since we are providing the starting and length to slice this should be O(1) - direct access to nth character in the string. Then doing a direct update to a dict with the counts: O(1). Then adding the unique area codes to a set and sorting it. Not sure what Python sort method is used, but concensus seems to be the sorted method would be O(nlog n) for worst case.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TASK4

Builds multiple sets - requires two for loops and two union operations: O(len(s)+len(t)) according to Python Wiki TIme Complexity for the union operations. Uses x in s operation to find whether calling numbers are in the combined set: O(n) is worst case. Uses sorted function twice: once to sort all numbers to check and once to sort the calling list. These should have O(n log n) each as worst case.
